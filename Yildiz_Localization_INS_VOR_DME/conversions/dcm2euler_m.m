function euler_m = dcm2euler_m(DCMnb_m)
% dcm2euler_m: transforms a nav-to-body DCM matrix to an Euler angles matrix.
%
% INPUT
%   DCMnb_m: Nx9 matrix with nav-to-body direct cosine matrices (DCM).
% Each row of DCMnb_m contains the 9 elements of a particular DCMnb
% matrix ordered as [a11 a21 a31 a12 a22 a32 a13 a23 a33].
%
% OUTPUT
%   euler_m: Nx3 Euler angles ordered by column, [roll pitch yaw] (rad, rad, rad).
